# FQSqueezer - FASTQ compressor based on k-mer statistics

FQSqueezer is an experimental high-end compression of FASTQ files. The main goal of the tool is to offer the best possible compression ratio with running times allowing to run it even for WGS human datasets.

FQSqueezer usually offers compression ratios tens of percent better than given by the state-of-the-art tools, like FaStore, Minicom, Spring. The running times are, however, significantly longer.
